# BetterGradient

BetterGradient is a small test-bed for generating better looking gradients by converting to the HCL colorspace. It may eventually be utilized within Unity3D, GIMP, Krita, Photoshop, etc.

### Usage

* Download the test.html file and open it in your browser.

* Simply choose the colors by clicking on the boxes and two sets of gradients will get generated - RGB and HCL.

* Clicking anywhere within the gradients will select the color at that point and display the HTML code, RGB values and HCL values for it.

* Hovering anywhere within the gradients with a color already selected will show a comparison between these values.
