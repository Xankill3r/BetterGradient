# BetterGradient

BetterGradient is a small test-bed for generating better looking gradients by converting to the LCH colorspace. It may eventually be used as a plugin within Unity3D, GIMP, Krita, Photoshop, etc.

### Usage

* Download the test.html file and open it in your browser.

* Simply choose the colors by clicking on the boxes and three sets of gradients will get generated - RGB, linear RGB and LCH.

* Hovering anywhere within the gradients will show a comparison between these values.

### Based on

Currently uses the Chrome.js library for proof of concept. Final versions (Photoshop, Unity, GIMP, etc) will be based on different code.
