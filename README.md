# BetterGradient

BetterGradient is a small test-bed for generating better looking gradients by converting to the LCH colorspace. It may eventually be used as a plugin within Unity3D, GIMP, Krita, Photoshop, etc.

### Usage

* Download the test.html file and open it in your browser.

* Simply choose the colors by clicking on the boxes and three sets of gradients will get generated - RGB, linear RGB and LCH.

* Hovering anywhere within the gradients will show a comparison between these values.
